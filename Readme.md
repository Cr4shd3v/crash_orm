# Crash ORM

[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/crash_orm.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/crash_orm)

A simple, typed ORM for Postgres.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use API to interact with your postgres database.

**NOTE**: This is a fairly young project, and it may experience breaking changes through MINOR versions. Patch versions will never break your code.

**ALSO NOTE**: I won't add any other database engine until version 1.0 or until I replace tokio_postgres with a different library.

## Documentation
The Documentation is located [at docs.rs](https://docs.rs/crash_orm/latest/crash_orm/).

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Cr4shd3v/crash_orm/issues/new/choose) if you need more / better documentation of a part of this package.

## Reporting Issues / Requesting features

Always feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Cr4shd3v/crash_orm/issues/new/choose) when you encounter a bug or when you are missing a feature.

I will try to implement as many features as possible, especially considering the structure of this ORM.
