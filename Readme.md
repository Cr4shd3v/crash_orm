# Crash ORM

A simple, typed ORM for Postgres.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use API to interact with your postgres database.

**NOTE**: This is a fairly young project, and it may experience breaking changes through MINOR versions. Patch versions will never break your code.

**ALSO NOTE**: I won't add any other database engine until version 1.0 or until I replace tokio_postgres with a different library.

## Getting Started

You can find the Getting Started Page [here](docs/Getting%20Started/Readme.md).

## Documentation
The Documentation is located [here](docs/Readme.md).

However, the documentation is still expanding and some features are not documented yet.
Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Cr4shd3v/crash_orm/issues/new/choose) if you need more / better documentation of a part of this package.

## Reporting Issues / Requesting features

Always feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Cr4shd3v/crash_orm/issues/new/choose) when you encounter a bug or when you are missing a feature.
I will try to implement as many features as possible, especially considering the structure of this ORM.
